## Features

- **Realistic Orbits**: Planetary motion based on Kepler's laws, with data obtained from NASA.
- **Rotating Planets**: Each planet rotates around its own axis according to its real rotation period.
- **Interactive UI**: Click on any planet to view additional information.
- **Adjustable Time Scale**: Use a slider to change the speed of time and observe the effects on orbital motion.
- **Realistic Textures and Atmosphere**: Each planet has unique textures, including Saturn's rings and Venus's atmospheric coloring.


## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: 3D rendering library used for creating the orrery and animations.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Programming language for logic, interactions, and animations.
- **HTML/CSS**: Base web technologies for structuring and styling the web app.
- **NASA Keplerian Data**: Data source for the accurate modeling of planetary orbits.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Web App**: Clone the repository and use `python -m http.server 8000` in a terminal window in the same directory to start a local server. Then, navigate to `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.
2. **Navigate the Scene**: Select the Viewer you want to use. If you use the 3D viewer, use the mouse or touch controls to rotate, zoom, and pan around the solar system.
3. **Adjust Time Scale**: Use the sliders to speed up or slow down the planetary movements.
4. **View Planet Details**: Click on a planet to display its information in the popup.


## Conclusion

This solar system orrery provides an interactive and educational experience to explore planetary movements and characteristics. By leveraging real physics and visual elements, it aims to enhance understanding of our celestial neighbors. Enjoy your journey through space!
